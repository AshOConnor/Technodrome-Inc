              <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
              <br>
              <br>
            <p>The tools and technologies required to develop this app range from a few different hardware options and software options. First, we all decide on as a team is what the type of app we are going to be creating by collating prototypes of the app, agreeing as a team, and building from that decision. The next thing we must decide on as a team is if we want to code this app for Android only or if we want to develop the app for iOS only.
               If we chose to go with the android version for the time being as we start up, we will need to have access to a Windows computer with a minimum of at least 4GB of ram and 2.5GHz of processing power (Margain, 2021).</p>

            <img src="img/website.png" alt=""></center>
            <br><br>
            <p>The software that we will be using to create and build our application is called Zoho Creator, it contains an ultimate range of features enabling our team to get Yes Chef up and running. The cost amount monthly to be able to use this software is $312.75 which provides access for all 6 team members. The features that Zoho creature includes business data and collaboration across teams, insightful reports, and a prominent level of security.
               Zoho creator also takes out the major effort of  coding lines and lines of data by using a low code platform. (Zoho - Cloud Software Suite and SaaS Applications for Businesses, 2021).</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>We will also need an assorted range of handheld devices; these at this moment in time included a Google Pixel 3, a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus and a Samsung Galaxy S8. Once we have pushed the Android version out, we can start focusing on iOS then we will need to purchase an Apple iPhone 8, Apple iPhone XR and an Apple iPad 6th Gen (BrowserStack, 2021). Having these devices will enable us to test the features and quality of our app before we push it to go public. Once our app has been established in the world after a few months we can then start developing our business to support other handheld devices.</p>

            <br><br>
            <p>As for experience within the team, there is quite a broad range of experience within the team. Ash, Brendan, and Mark all have some understanding of Python coding, and they may be able to use this to their advantage when needing to code any of the app. Chris, Eddie and Kim have a general understanding of UI design and development, which will be a great strength for the team.
               The whole team have a great understanding of web development and if necessary, can take turns helping with the  development of the app. Overall the Technodrome Inc. team has a great understanding of how to create a website and will peruse any dream they have this being the implementation of the Yes Chef app.
