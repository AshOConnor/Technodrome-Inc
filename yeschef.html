              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Topic:</strong>
                <br>Yes Chef is a hospitality application currently under development by Technodrome Inc. Yes
                Chef’s primary goal is to consolidate all aspects of kitchen administration, allowing a chef
                or manager to easily monitor and control the business component (food costing, recipes,
                daily invoicing and wage control). The app will take information from the user in the form
                of goods, operating percentages, profits & expenses to allow a day-to-day feedback on
                where the business sits both financially and stock wise. The application will also delve into
                rostering, ordering.
                <br>
                <br>In the manically busy world of hospitality the need for quick and easy behind the scenes
                operation is a must have for business, our team is determined to design and build an application
                that is easy to use, intuitive and provides up to date and relevant information for the user.
                <br>
                Based on the Philosophy of being user friendly Yes Chef! will be the go-to application for the
                Hospitality industry.

              <p><strong>Motivation:</strong></P>
                <p style="color:green">“As of 30 June 2016 there were 85,284 eating out establishments in Australia. The highest
                <br>number (29,432) were fast food outlets, comprising 34.5% of the national total.”</p>

                  <br>
                  <br>Sixty five percent of the hospitality industry is comprised of venues that potentially require
                  administration of product and product costing and yet the there is a complete lack of an
                  application that tackles the behind the scenes of kitchen operation. We questioned chefs
                  from all over the world to ask them what they would expect from our app.
                </P>

                <p style="color:green">“It would need to track staff times so the ability to enter hours worked, food cost it would need to have
                  the ability to put in stock received and then track stock usage, possibly a barcode scanner for products
                  and the ability to enter weights and measures. Other tracking is a bit more complicated as breaking
                  down electricity and gas etc is more of an overall running cost than a kitchen specific cost.”

                  <br>“Something easy to use to add recipes an also universal measures like both pounds ounces liters grams etc. Different
                  nationalities use different measures.”

                  <br>“We use ctb at work, one of the things I have noticed is when a supplier changes their prices on items they don't
                  actually notify you which can lead to massive variances, we spend about 15 to 20 grand a week on stock so you can
                  imagine how much money we make on food a week, when I do our weekly stock take I notice certain variances.”

                <p>
                  <br>This list and similar lists have very useful applications which are limited in scope. Hospitality
                  <br>targeted apps like ‘Lightspeed’ concentrate on recipe costing without the ability to make the
                  <br>dish part of the whole or useful beyond costing the dish. Mark Berry one of our team
                  <br>members has encountered these challenges in his previous roles in the hospitality industry
                  <br>and has had to created workarounds by using spread sheets.

              <h3>Aims</h3>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Yes Chef Primary Objective: </strong> 
                <br>The primary objective of this project is to create an application called Yes Chef that will
                classify as an administration tool for the hospitality industry, this application will take
                some months to construct as there are many key features to introduce and develop.
                <br>
                <br>Tecnodrome has set an artwork and basic demo deadline of the 22nd of August 2021,
                at this time we will have a Figma demonstration, video presentation & Alternate approaches
                for design available to plan our final product. 
                <br>
                <br><strong>Develop artwork concepts for application pages:</strong> 
                <br>Tecnodrome has a wonderfully creative team, our company encourages free thinking and
                expression, this is especially important when dealing with artistic design, we like to
                consider multiple approaches to our vision, each team member contributes to the basic design
                stage so that the group has options for directional decision making.  
                <br>
                <br><strong>Develop navigation:</strong> 
                <br>Our navigation development stage is to be a visual flow diagram of how the application
                will interact with itself, it must show the information that is shared with the user
                and the information is shared to other parts of the application separately, this will act as a
                roadmap for the development team giving them basic information on each of the application 
                sections requirements.  
                <br>
                <br><strong>Develop basic interface demonstrations:</strong> 
                <br>Tecnodrome’s Engineers & web development team have been busy working on our
                <br>first interactive demonstration, although this is a long way from the finished product
                <br>it will allow us a concise target to a aim for. 
                <br>

              <h3>Plans & Progress</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Technodrome Inc, through the challenging work and dedication our wonderful team we have the opportunity to introduce to the world of Hospitality the new essential app to have in any Hospitality business. This app is called “Yes Chef” and this project arose from our CTO Mark’s experiences working in hospitality for (20) years. Over the years he spent a significant amount of time devising different solutions to these numerous logistical challenges ever present in the daily functioning of any hospitality business. After spending years working with adequate but headache inducing spreadsheets, he knew there must be a better way. Now with the backing of a motivated team to share his vision we hope to bring these basic ideas to a practical reality to relieve the unnecessary struggles of those who work in hospitality. We hope that through the development of the app ‘Yes Chef’ we can improve and help bring advancements to this section of the Hospitality industry and make the
              overall process much easier for all hospitality businesses that choose to use our app. Technology is an amazing and useful tool for humanity and should be implemented into as many areas as possible, we believe here at Technodome. Inc, as said by Albert Einstein "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."
              <br><br>At this point in time, we have a clear outline of what we want to achieve and have made significant steps towards achieving that goal. With core user interface design and interactive prototyping underway we are in the process of refining usability through at first our own internal iterative design process.
              <br><br>
              <strong>Functions that we plan to include into the completed version of App are: </strong>
              <br><br>
              <strong> - Ordering Supplies and Ingredients:</strong> <br>Supplies on hand tracking via barcode scanning or manual entry allowing for flexible workflows. Ability to tag storage location via barcode or NFC tag to improve efficiency
              <br><br>
              <strong> - Dish Costing: </strong> <br>Fully customisable and suitable for almost any hospitality recipe costing utilising price per unit, unit quantities and price per weight. Tightly integrated with the ordering and ingredient tracking features to allow for on hand supply tracking if desired.
              <br><br>
              <strong> - A Digital Recipe Book:</strong> <br>Recipe book that can be used standalone, or again with shared functionality linked to dish costing and supply management. Search by title/content keywords or browse by sorted and customisable categories. Useful for managing different sets of menus or quickly pulling up recipes including specific ingredients.
              <br><br>
              <strong> - Invoice Tracking:</strong> <br>The invoice tracking feature In Yes Chef, will be a digitalized logbook scoring all purchases and invoices. By adding prices from all invoices, the application will be able to create a database regarding cost of each individual item used by the user's business. This data can then be used in other function of Yes Chef such as monitoring dish costing and price monitoring. (As development progresses, we hope to implement an API to enable suppliers and businesses to further automate the invoicing and ordering workflow.)
              <br><br>
              <strong> - Cost Monitoring by the Item:</strong> <br>Any hospitality business cannot operate without the purchases of supplies and ingredients. When doing so it is especially important to also be mindful how much each of the required purchases is costing the business. In the times we currently are living in it is common for the prices to fluctuate and if left unchecked this can dramatically affect the budget for any business. Through this feature in Yes Chef, when a regularly purchases item increases this can be tracked over time. Providing valuable insight and directly assisting the decision-making involved in managing a profitable business.
              <br><br>
              <strong> - Rostering:</strong> <br>When it comes to organizing and allocating hours for team members to work each week can be a difficult and tedious job. Industry standard rostering features quickly and easily accessible for both employee and employer. Emphasis on quick readability and visual representation of schedules and times. Easily note and view employee available times, loading and shift management
              <br><br>
              <strong> - Team Communication:</strong> <br>Communication is essential in any team, that is why we have incorporated a team communication feature in Yes Chef. Through this feature of the app, team leaders/supervisors can distribute weekly rosters to the entire team via email. Team members will be able to also communicate with team leaders and supervisors via smaller version of Yes Chef installed in their phones.
              <br><br>
              <strong> - Customisable Interface:</strong> <br>Our desire here at Technodrome Inc. is for ‘Yes Chef” to be a useful tool for all Hospitality businesses not just limited to restaurants and kitchens. Every business is as unique as every member of staff and team involved in running it, with all this in mind we want our app to be fully customizable, so it can be shaped to fit the requirements for all hospitality businesses big and small. With these customizable functions other businesses such as small Cafes and snack kiosks can benefit from the app as well. We do not wish for our users to have to change or adapt their procedures to be able to use our app, instead we want the app to be mouldable and to be shaped to suit the user's needs.

              <br><br>

              <strong>Dead ends and Changes made along the way:</strong> <br>When trying to construct an interactable prototype of Yes Chef, we faced some difficulty when trying to decide what software and program to use in the construction. We wanted to find an easy-to-use program that would allow multiple members of our team to participate and collaborate in the making of a prototype. Some of the other platforms we first tried out were found to be confusing when collaborating with other teammates, limiting in the creating the appearance of the application or was unclear to use for beginner app creators. Unfortunately for many of us on the team, we have never participated in the creation of any application before, so we required a simpler app creator platform. After some time of searching, we settled on using platform called Figma, it was a platform that met all our requirements for our first prototyping phase. <br> Once the process of creating an actual prototype for Yes chef began, we were faced with the reality that taking our ideas from paper and making them into a functional and working application will require a few modifications and adjustments.

                    entered in said fields, by organizing various aspects of business management and breaking them down into a simple and easy to use user interface,
                    Yes Chef’s design can help small businesses the world over get a tighter grip on their finance.
                    <br>
                    <br><strong>Scope of work</strong>
                    <br>Here are the steps that will be taken to complete Yes Chef and the expected timeframe of completion.
                    <br>
                    <br>Assemble Team - June, week one, 2021
                    <br>Establish project goals as a team - June, week two, 2021
                    <br>Begin development of basic features - June, week four, 2021
                    <br>Create website mockup - July, week two, 2021
                    <br>Begin Marketing Campaign with established artifacts - August, week three, 2021
                    <br>Refine basic features - August, week five, 2021
                    <br>Finish graphics design overhaul - September, week three, 2021
                    <br>Bug test application for launch - November, week one, 2021
                    <br>Complete website overhaul - November, week four, 2021
                    <br>Release to Yes Chef to the public - December, week four, 2021
                    <br>Begin initial maintenance phase - December/ ongoing
                    <br>
                    <br>• Project Schedule
                    <br>Yes Chef started development in June 2021 and once successfully launched to the public will continue to be updated, Yes chef is currently in the
                    Development phase and further work is required before release.
                    <br>
                    <br>By August 22nd, the team will produce tangible artifacts to provide proof of concept for the product. These artifacts are aimed to be a prototype with at least two working sections and various design snapshots to aid in visualization of the Project. Once proof of concept is achieved, the team will continue to conduct regularly scheduled meetings every Tuesday and Thursday. This will continue until the project can be finalized for release. In this phase, all website design will be completed and ready for launch as well as all coding finalized for the basic product. Deadlines are in place and decided as upcoming tasks draw near.
                    The Development phase is scheduled to end in December 2021 and will be marked by the completion of final bug testing.
                    <br>
                    <br>The marketing phase is focused on gaining exposure and adoption, with a basic product now functioning, the development team will be reduced to two members who are responsible for keeping services online and fixing bugs Biweekly, releasing any scheduled monthly updates featuring optimization, graphical upgrades, and quality of life patches. Resources will be directed towards gaining partnerships and running advertisements. The adoption of the application will be gauged during this ongoing period, and it will be determined then if the team will divert more resources to Research and Development.
                    <br>
                    <br>• Success Criteria and Sign-off
                    <br>The conclusion of this project Development phase will be signaled by the successful release of Yes Chef onto the Android Play Store. Before initial release, Technodome inc’s landing page must undergo a design overhaul that will be tailored towards market research findings, the information obtained during Development. The occasion of release will be recognized via email announcement to investors and potential customers. The project is then to be carried forward from a maintenance perspective or until further developments are ready for implementation.

              <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
              <br>
              <br>
            <p>The tools and technologies required to develop this app range from a few different hardware options and software options. First, we all decide on as a team is what the type of app we are going to be creating by collating prototypes of the app, agreeing as a team, and building from that decision.
            <br><br>The next thing we must decide on as a team is if we want to code this app for Android only or if we want to develop the app for iOS only.
            If we chose to go with the android version for the time being as we start up, we will need to have access to a Windows computer with a minimum of at least 4GB of ram and 2.5GHz of processing power (Margain, 2021).
            <br><br>
            The software that we will be using to create and build our application is called Zoho Creator, it contains an ultimate range of features enabling our team to get Yes Chef up and running. The cost amount monthly to be able to use this software is $312.75 which provides access for all 6 team members.
            <br><br>The features that Zoho creature includes business data and collaboration across teams, insightful reports, and a prominent level of security.
            Zoho creator also takes out the major effort of  coding lines and lines of data by using a low code platform. (Zoho - Cloud Software Suite and SaaS Applications for Businesses, 2021).
            <br><br>
            We will also need an assorted range of handheld devices; these at this moment in time included a Google Pixel 3, a Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus and a Samsung Galaxy S8. Once we have pushed the Android version out, we can start focusing on iOS then we will need to purchase an Apple iPhone 8, Apple iPhone XR and an Apple iPad 6th Gen (BrowserStack, 2021).
            <br><br>Having these devices will enable us to test the features and quality of our app before we push it to go public. Once our app has been established in the world after a few months we can then start developing our business to support other handheld devices.
            <br><br>As for experience within the team, there is quite a broad range of experience within. Ash, Brendan, and Mark all have some understanding of Python coding, and they may be able to use this to their advantage when needing to code any of the app.
            <br><br> Chris, Eddie and Kim have a general understanding of UI design and development, which will be a great strength for the team.
            The whole team have a great understanding of web development and if necessary, can take turns helping with the  development of the app.
            <br><br>Overall the Technodrome Inc. team has a great understanding of how to create a website and will peruse any dream they have this being the implementation of the Yes Chef app.

              <h3>Testing</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Internal prototype testing for usability. Making use of our Mark’s (our CTO) vision and experience in the industry. If there are any questions along the way, we will reach out to contacts within the industry for input on desired features.
              <br><br>
              Once we have workable prototypes we will present and share them with people who have experience in the industry and ask them to rate each feature across a range of functionality and usability criteria. We will then use this data to inform our decisions when creating further iterations of the design. Once we reach a stage where we deem the application to be working as intended, we will search for candidates willing to trial run the software in real work environments for longer periods of time and encourage them to give more detailed qualitative feedback.
              <br><br>When conducting the trial runs of the application, we wish to have testers from various areas in the hospitality industry. From busy restaurants to local cafes and anything in between as we wish to gather as much feedback as possible to make Yes Chef a useful tool for a range of hospitality businesses. Based on the gathered feedback we will analyse it and expose the areas in which we require improving. Once the required areas are exposed, we will carry out the required changes to improve the overall app experience.
              <br><br>
              Once we have obtained a large amount of data and made several improvements and release Yes Chef to the Hospitality Industry. For us here at Technodrome, success in Yes Chef will be when the overall feedback for our beloved app becomes more positive than negative and the number of users begins to increase steadily. Once the users of Yes Chef begin to rely more on our application rather than their physical records and books that is when we feel the true success of this app will be achieved. Our aim with Yes Chef is to digitalize and take over the administration side of any hospitality business and simplify the overall process for any business using Yes Chef.
              </p>

            <br><br><br>


              <h3>Timeframe</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Each team member to spend 8-10 hours per week on their given task. This includes time spent in meetings and helping others which is just as important as individual work. As many of our skills overlap. Assigned tasks are somewhat flexible and have been described simply and broadly in the planner to allow for people's initiative and creativity to guide them. Especially in the early stages as we need to be able to pivot around each other's ideas, favouring new avenues that progress our core goals and ideas.The basic timeframe we work to has us using an agile style project management and task assigning system. Using the built in Kanban features in Microsoft teams.
              <br><br><strong>Week 6 First major Milestone:</strong>
              <br>Our preliminary goal for the end of week 6 is to have a general outline and multiple preview prototypes for the app UI. Detailed outlines of all the features. Along with a cohesive vision explained and presented in a video presentation. Moving on from here we will continue to research and flesh out the specifics of the features in design and functionality. Generating multiple prototype proposals at once for team evaluation.

              <br><br><strong>Week 10 Checkpoint:</strong>
              <br>Have a second checkpoint of revisions and check in with how our current designs and ideas match up with what we defined earlier in the project. Then evaluate on any differences and either adopt these changes or refine what we have, to better fit our original vision. If we can, start implementing some of these core features into functional versions.

              <br><br><strong>Week 13 Checkpoint:</strong>
              <br>Check in with how all these refinements are tracking and look to consolidate all our work into as polished product as possible to hit the end of week 15 with something we can present to the public.

              <br><br><strong>Week 15 Milestone:</strong>
              <br>By this point we should have a well presentable and hopefully have some of the basic core features functioning in a deliverable application. Finalised and polished website describing a detailed and up to date version of our software and our progress thus far. <br><br><img src="img/timeframe.png"class="timeframeimg"><br>

              <h3>Risks</h3>
              <br>
              <p>With any project, regardless of size or complexity, there will always be inherent and generalised risks. Yes Chef has a long yet accomplishable road ahead of it due to its specific risks, some of those risks being:
                <br><br>
                <strong> It is new.</strong>
                <br>
                Not just the product itself, but the whole idea behind it. There is currently nothing on the public market that Technodrome has been able to find that functions like Yes Chef will. Not only will Technodrome need to be marketing this product to prospective buyers, but multiple test restaurants and cafés will need to be sourced prior to this to adequately test Yes Chef to ensure that it operates as intended. Ease of use will be the biggest risk here as Yes Chef needs to “just work”. While familiarisation with any processes builds speed, Yes Chef will need to prove that, at a minimum, it is comparably quick as current processes with limited to no formal training.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Supplier Integration.</strong>
                <br>
                Development towards API access for suppliers for ordering and invoicing is a future milestone for Yes Chef and a feature that Technodrome will be working hard towards. While this feature will allow seamless integration of Yes Chef between customers and suppliers, it will bring with it the added risks associated with suppliers and their supply chains. Not only this, but Yes Chef will need to be demonstrably better or complementary to a supplier's current systems and processes and be compatible with their hardware. This milestone feature will need to be able to operate concurrently with the manual ordering and invoicing processes that Yes Chef will be released with. There are multiple reasons for this, including but not limited to:
                <br>
                &emsp;- It will provide alternative manual supplier options for customers should their primary supplier fall short of demand<br>&emsp;&ensp;for whatever reason.
                <br>
                &emsp;- Internet failure. Yes Chef will still be able to produce manual orders and invoices.
                <br>
                &emsp;- Supplier end technical issues.
                <br>
                &emsp;- API failure.
                <br><br>
                <strong>User and Supplier Acceptance.</strong>
                <br>
                Continuing on from the first point, It’s new. Larger and pre-existing businesses will already have their own processes which they are familiar and comfortable with, while smaller businesses like the corner café may not see the need or benefit. Ease of use again becomes paramount in the success of Yes Chef being implemented into businesses.
                <br><br>
                <strong>User Growth.</strong>
                <br>
                It is possible, be it initially or eventually, Yes Chef could have a rapid intake of users. Technodrome needs to be prepared or have in place an infrastructure expansion plan that can rapidly change and evolve to ensure that there is minimal to no disturbance in user experience.
                <br><br>
                Technodrome  will continue to analyse its operation and application design both during and after release to assess new risks and mitigate them wherever possible.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>


              <h3>Group Processes and communications</h3>
              <br>
              <p>Technodrome has an agreed policy of two meeting per week these are Video conferences implemented though Microsoft Team, in addition
                Tecnodrome keeps several channels open on its Discord server for more casual communication, This allows members working on similar topics to
                come and go from live chat while engaging in work.
              <br>
              <br>Technodrome has had past issues with team members not communicating with its team members, moving into this stage of the
              project every team member has agreed to certain time constraints for the project, as with any company team members are subject to
              disciplinary actions or dismissal for severe offences.
              <br>
              <br>Technodrome as a variety of working options for its members in relation to teamwork, some members like to take on
              specific tasks as a smaller solo projects to be added back into the greater project later on.
              Others prefer to work side by side with each other live in team. Technodrome also uses Git & GitHub for all of its company’s
              coding, this allows multiple team members to collaborate at the same time without causing issues.

              <h3>Skills and Jobs</h3>
              <br>
              <p><strong>Skills and Jobs</strong>
              <br>The planned job roles that would be required to take the project to the next phase require proficiency
              in the following 5 skills to perform effectively on the project, all employees will require a baseline
              competency of these 5 skills.
              <br>
              <br>Analytical Skills
              <br>Written and verbal communication skills
              <br>Creativity
              <br>Initiative
              <br>Problem solving
              <br>
              <br>The following roles and descriptions are that which will be employed in a four-person team.
              <br>
              <br><strong>Application Developer</strong>
              <br>The main task for a developer is to process and create User interfaces and work on user experience.
              It is required to have previous experience with programming languages Kotlin and Java for the initial
              Release on Android and Windows. Html and CSS will be required as standard and eventually there
              will be need for objective-c and swift languages as iOS is scheduled to release after Android.
              <br>
              <br>A 2019 study from University of Bonn (University, Germany) indicated that on average, most developers don’t implement sufficient cyber security unless explicitly prompted to do so. An article published on Zdnet (ZDNET, news publisher, published March 2019, zdnet.com) explained that the study involved academics from The University of Bonn requesting 260 freelance App Developers to design a mock up social media site using various programing languages and report on these results. The findings showed that 18 out of the final 43 participants needed to be asked to resubmit their project with sufficient data security. The report concluded that out of the 8 password security functions implemented, only 2 of them are recognized as secure within the industry. The study suggests a trend in modern freelance developers lacking knowledge in basic cyber security. In a world rapidly becoming digitally focused, It is of upmost importance that the team's app developer is aware of modern techniques to store user data securely.
              <br>
              <br><strong>Software Designer</strong>
              <br>Software Designers are required to work on the application development and help to test the user interface
              and experience. They will use technical skills in CSS and Html to create a stable website for launch as well as
              improve the applications styles, animations and imagery overall, adding character and appeal to the design for
              users.
              <br>
              <br>According to an article published on indeed.com (Indeed, employment company, analytics/ recruitment,
              established 2004, United States), “Software engineers are required to develop, design, maintain, modify
              and debug software” (Software Engineer Skills: Definition and Examples, paragraph one, line one, Article,
              Indeed editorial team, published December 9th 2020). Using assorted code visualization tools
              (Atom/ Studio Code Viewer) as well as graphic design tools (adobe photoshop/ premiere), the Software
              designer will help produce and maintain the basic functions of the application but is responsible
              more so for the visual elements than base function.
              <br>
              <br><strong>Quality Assurance specialist</strong>
              <br>To conclude milestones in development, the team will require a Quality Assurance specialist.
              The software development team could infinitely develop the application with updates and tweaks,
              and this is where a QA is required. Quality Assurance Specialists are responsible for testing products
              and providing feedback to the development team regarding whether a product meets its goals and is fit
              for public release. The Quality assurance specialist will work closely with the Development team, testing
              progress regularly by performing reviews, polls and bug testing.
              <br>
              A recent blog posted on Getreskilled (Blog, published December 2019, GetreSkilled.com, News publisher, est. 2008)
              has indicated the specific personal skills that are required by a quality assurance specialist typically:
              <br>
              <br> Analytical Skills – the role often requires heavy collection and organization of data to be
              used in comparisons and help uncover trends.
              <br>
              <br>Critical and logical thinking - Quality assurance can be problem identification focused. It is
              important that QA’s can suggest convenient solutions to aid in efficiency for the developers.
              <br>
              <br>Attention to detail – QA’s must have a keen eye to notice when functions return improper or
              unappealing results. QA’s will also be knowledgeable about industry regulations and be able to explain
              how the app is to comply with them.
              <br>
              <br>Most importantly, a Quality Assurance Specialist will need to be proficient in written and
              verbal communication. It is important that they can identify technical errors, provide plausible
              solutions or feedback and be able to explain all of this to uniquely skilled departments efficiently and
              effectively.
              <br>
              <br><strong>Sales and Marketing Specialist</strong>
              <br>Finally, Yes Chef’s four-person team will require a Sales and Marketing Specialist. During Development,
              it is inevitable that the Designers and Developers will procure tangible artifacts that can be used as demos
              for sales and marketing purposes. With specialists in this field on board from the start, they will be able to
              work alongside the rest of the team to use these artifacts to influence potential investors or to feature in
              advertising campaigns. If Yes Chef is Unknown to the public, it cannot fulfil its purpose of assisting them.
              The sales specialist is integral for turning team efforts into profits and simultaneously financial support
              for the applications future.
              <br>
              <br>According to the Report summary: Exchanging skills in sales and Marketing
              (study/report, Employment-Studies.co.uk) the occupation specific skills include:
