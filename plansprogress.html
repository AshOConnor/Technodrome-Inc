    <H1> Plans and Progress </H1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> Technodrome Inc, through the challenging work and dedication our wonderful team we have the opportunity to introduce to the world of Hospitality the new essential app to have in any Hospitality business. This app is called “Yes Chef” and this project arose from our CTO Mark’s experiences working in hospitality for (20) years. Over the years he spent a significant amount of time devising different solutions to these numerous logistical challenges ever present in the daily functioning of any hospitality business. After spending years working with adequate but headache inducing spreadsheets, he knew there must be a better way. Now with the backing of a motivated team to share his vision we hope to bring these basic ideas to a practical reality to relieve the unnecessary struggles of those who work in hospitality. We hope that through the development of the app ‘Yes Chef’ we can improve and help bring advancements to this section of the Hospitality industry and make the
    overall process much easier for all hospitality businesses that choose to use our app. Technology is an amazing and useful tool for humanity and should be implemented into as many areas as possible, we believe here at Technodome. Inc, as said by Albert Einstein "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."
    <br><br>At this point in time, we have a clear outline of what we want to achieve and have made significant steps towards achieving that goal. With core user interface design and interactive prototyping underway we are in the process of refining usability through at first our own internal iterative design process.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Functions that we plan to include into the completed version of App are: </strong>
    <br><br>
    <strong> - Ordering Supplies and Ingredients:</strong> <br>Supplies on hand tracking via barcode scanning or manual entry allowing for flexible workflows. Ability to tag storage location via barcode or NFC tag to improve efficiency
    <br><br>
    <strong> - Dish Costing: </strong> <br>Fully customisable and suitable for almost any hospitality recipe costing utilising price per unit, unit quantities and price per weight. Tightly integrated with the ordering and ingredient tracking features to allow for on hand supply tracking if desired.
    <br><br>
    <strong> - A Digital Recipe Book:</strong> <br>Recipe book that can be used standalone, or again with shared functionality linked to dish costing and supply management. Search by title/content keywords or browse by sorted and customisable categories. Useful for managing different sets of menus or quickly pulling up recipes including specific ingredients.
    <br><br>
    <strong> - Invoice Tracking:</strong> <br>The invoice tracking feature In Yes Chef, will be a digitalized logbook scoring all purchases and invoices. By adding prices from all invoices, the application will be able to create a database regarding cost of each individual item used by the user's business. This data can then be used in other function of Yes Chef such as monitoring dish costing and price monitoring. (As development progresses, we hope to implement an API to enable suppliers and businesses to further automate the invoicing and ordering workflow.)
    <br><br>
    <strong> - Cost Monitoring by the Item:</strong> <br>Any hospitality business cannot operate without the purchases of supplies and ingredients. When doing so it is especially important to also be mindful how much each of the required purchases is costing the business. In the times we currently are living in it is common for the prices to fluctuate and if left unchecked this can dramatically affect the budget for any business. Through this feature in Yes Chef, when a regularly purchases item increases this can be tracked over time. Providing valuable insight and directly assisting the decision-making involved in managing a profitable business.
    <br><br>
    <strong> - Rostering:</strong> <br>When it comes to organizing and allocating hours for team members to work each week can be a difficult and tedious job. Industry standard rostering features quickly and easily accessible for both employee and employer. Emphasis on quick readability and visual representation of schedules and times. Easily note and view employee available times, loading and shift management
    <br><br>
    <strong> - Team Communication:</strong> <br>Communication is essential in any team, that is why we have incorporated a team communication feature in Yes Chef. Through this feature of the app, team leaders/supervisors can distribute weekly rosters to the entire team via email. Team members will be able to also communicate with team leaders and supervisors via smaller version of Yes Chef installed in their phones.
    <br><br>
    <strong> - Customisable Interface:</strong> <br>Our desire here at Technodrome Inc. is for ‘Yes Chef” to be a useful tool for all Hospitality businesses not just limited to restaurants and kitchens. Every business is as unique as every member of staff and team involved in running it, with all this in mind we want our app to be fully customizable, so it can be shaped to fit the requirements for all hospitality businesses big and small. With these customizable functions other businesses such as small Cafes and snack kiosks can benefit from the app as well. We do not wish for our users to have to change or adapt their procedures to be able to use our app, instead we want the app to be mouldable and to be shaped to suit the user's needs.

    <br><br><br><br>

    <strong>Dead ends and Changes made along the way:</strong> <br>When trying to construct an interactable prototype of Yes Chef, we faced some difficulty when trying to decide what software and program to use in the construction. We wanted to find an easy-to-use program that would allow multiple members of our team to participate and collaborate in the making of a prototype. Some of the other platforms we first tried out were found to be confusing when collaborating with other teammates, limiting in the creating the appearance of the application or was unclear to use for beginner app creators. Unfortunately for many of us on the team, we have never participated in the creation of any application before, so we required a simpler app creator platform. After some time of searching, we settled on using platform called Figma, it was a platform that met all our requirements for our first prototyping phase. <br> Once the process of creating an actual prototype for Yes chef began, we were faced with the reality that taking our ideas from paper and making them into a functional and working application will require a few modifications and adjustments.
