    <H1> Plans and Progress </H1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p> Technodrome Inc, through the challenging work and dedication our wonderful team we have the opportunity to introduce to the world of Hospitality the new essential app to have in any Hospitality business. This app is called “Yes Chef” and this project arose from our CTO Mark’s experiences working in hospitality for (20) years. Over the years he spent a significant amount of time devising different solutions to these numerous logistical challenges ever present in the daily functioning of any hospitality business. After spending years working with adequate but headache inducing spreadsheets, he knew there must be a better way. Now with the backing of a motivated team to share his vision we hope to bring these basic ideas to a practical reality to relieve the unnecessary struggles of those who work in hospitality. We hope that through the development of the app ‘Yes Chef’ we can improve and help bring advancements to this section of the Hospitality industry and make the
    overall process much easier for all hospitality businesses that choose to use our app. Technology is an amazing and useful tool for humanity and should be implemented into as many areas as possible, we believe here at Technodome. Inc, as said by Albert Einstein "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."
    <br><br>At this point in time, we have a clear outline of what we want to achieve and have made significant steps towards achieving that goal. With core user interface design and interactive prototyping underway we are in the process of refining usability through at first our own internal iterative design process.
    <br><br>
    <h2>Functions that we plan to include into the completed version of App are: </h2>
    <br>
    <strong> - Ordering Supplies and Ingredients:</strong> <br>Supplies on hand tracking via barcode scanning or manual entry allowing for flexible workflows. Ability to tag storage location via barcode or NFC tag to improve efficiency
    <br><br>
    <strong> - Dish Costing: </strong> <br>Fully customisable and suitable for almost any hospitality recipe costing utilising price per unit, unit quantities and price per weight. Tightly integrated with the ordering and ingredient tracking features to allow for on hand supply tracking if desired.
    <br><br>
    <strong> - A Digital Recipe Book:</strong> <br>Recipe book that can be used standalone, or again with shared functionality linked to dish costing and supply management. Search by title/content keywords or browse by sorted and customisable categories. Useful for managing different sets of menus or quickly pulling up recipes including specific ingredients.
