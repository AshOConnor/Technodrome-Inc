<h1>Risks</h1>
<p>
  With any project, regardless of size or complexity, there will always be inherent and generalised risks. Yes Chef has a long yet accomplishable road ahead of it due to its specific risks, some of those risks being:

  It is new.

  Not just the product itself, but the whole idea behind it. There is currently nothing on the public market that Technodrome has been able to find that functions like Yes Chef will. Not only will Technodrome need to be marketing this product to prospective buyers, but multiple test restaurants and cafés will need to be sourced prior to this to adequately test Yes Chef to ensure that it operates as intended. Ease of use will be the biggest risk here as Yes Chef needs to “just work”. While familiarisation with any processes builds speed, Yes Chef will need to prove that, at a minimum, it is comparably quick as current processes with limited to no formal training.

  Supplier Integration.

  Development towards API access for suppliers for ordering and invoicing is a future milestone for Yes Chef and a feature that Technodrome will be working hard towards. While this feature will allow seamless integration of Yes Chef between customers and suppliers, it will bring with it the added risks associated with suppliers and their supply chains. Not only this, but Yes Chef will need to be demonstrably better or complementary to a supplier's current systems and processes and be compatible with their hardware. This milestone feature will need to be able to operate concurrently with the manual ordering and invoicing processes that Yes Chef will be released with. There are multiple reasons for this, including but not limited to:

  It will provide alternative manual supplier options for customers should their primary supplier fall short of demand for whatever reason.

  Internet failure. Yes Chef will still be able to produce manual orders and invoices

  Supplier end technical issues

  API failure
  User and Supplier Acceptance.

  Continuing on from the first point, It’s new. Larger and pre-existing businesses will already have their own processes which they are familiar and comfortable with, while smaller businesses like the corner café may not see the need or benefit. Ease of use again becomes paramount in the success of Yes Chef being implemented into businesses.

  User Growth.

  It is possible, be it initially or eventually, Yes Chef could have a rapid intake of users. Technodrome needs to be prepared or have in place an infrastructure expansion plan that can rapidly change and evolve to ensure that there is minimal to no disturbance in user experience.



  Technodrome  will continue to analyse its operation and application design both during and after release to assess new risks and mitigate them wherever possible.
