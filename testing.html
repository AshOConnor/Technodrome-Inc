    <h1>Testing of Yes Chef</h1>
    <br>
    <br>


    <p>
      Internal prototype testing for usability. Making use of our Markâ€™s (our CTO) vision and experience in the industry. If there are any questions along the way, we will reach out to contacts within the industry for input on desired features.
      <br><br>
      Once we have workable prototypes we will present and share them with people who have experience in the industry and ask them to rate each feature across a range of functionality and usability criteria. We will then use this data to inform our decisions when creating further iterations of the design. Once we reach a stage where we deem the application to be working as intended, we will search for candidates willing to trial run the software in real work environments for longer periods of time and encourage them to give more detailed qualitative feedback. When conducting the trial runs of the application, we wish to have testers from various areas in the hospitality industry. From busy restaurants to local cafes and anything in between as we wish to gather as much feedback as possible to make Yes Chef a useful tool for a range of hospitality businesses. Based on the gathered feedback we will analyse it and expose the areas in which we require improving. Once the required areas are exposed, we will carry out the required changes to improve the overall app experience.
      <br><br>
      Once we have obtained a large amount of data and made several improvements and release Yes Chef to the Hospitality Industry. For us here at Technodrome, success in Yes Chef will be when the overall feedback for our beloved app becomes more positive than negative and the number of users begins to increase steadily. Once the users of Yes Chef begin to rely more on our application rather than their physical records and books that is when we feel the true success of this app will be achieved. Our aim with Yes Chef is to digitalize and take over the administration side of any hospitality business and simplify the overall process for any business using Yes Chef.
